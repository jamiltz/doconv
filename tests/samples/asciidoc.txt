Introduction
------------
{description}

AsciiDoc is highly configurable: both the AsciiDoc source file syntax
and the backend output markups (which can be almost any type of
SGML/XML markup) can be customized and extended by the user.

AsciiDoc is free software and is licenced under the terms of the 'GNU
General Public License version 2' (GPLv2).

TIP: The pages you are reading were written using AsciiDoc, to view
the corresponding AsciiDoc source click on the *Page Source* menu item
in the left hand margin.


Overview and Examples
---------------------
You write an AsciiDoc document the same way you would write a
normal text document, there are no markup tags or weird format
notations. AsciiDoc files are designed to be viewed, edited and
printed directly or translated to other presentation formats using
the asciidoc(1) command.

The asciidoc(1) command translates AsciiDoc files to HTML, XHTML and
DocBook markups.  DocBook can be post-processed to presentation
formats such as HTML, PDF, EPUB, DVI, LaTeX, roff, and Postscript
using readily available Open Source tools.

Example Articles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- This XHTML version of the
  link:asciidoc.css-embedded.html[AsciiDoc User Guide]
  was generated by AsciiDoc from
  link:asciidoc.txt[this AsciiDoc file].

- Here's the link:asciidoc.html[same document] created by first
  generating DocBook markup using AsciiDoc and then converting the
  DocBook markup to HTML using 'DocBook XSL Stylesheets'.

- The User Guide again, this time a
  link:chunked/index.html[chunked version].

- AsciiDoc generated this link:article-standalone.html[stand-alone
  HTML file] containing embedded CSS, JavaScript and images from this
  link:article.txt[AsciiDoc article template] with this command:

  asciidoc -a data-uri -a icons -a toc -a max-width=55em article.txt

- The same link:article.txt[AsciiDoc article template] generated
  link:article-html5-toc2.html[this HTML 5] (the 'toc2' attribute puts
  a table of contents in the left margin) from this command:

  asciidoc -b html5 -a icons -a toc2 -a theme=flask article.txt

- The same link:article.txt[AsciiDoc article template] produced
  this link:article.html[HTML file] and this
  link:article.pdf[PDF file] via DocBook markup generated by AsciiDoc.

Example Books
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
AsciiDoc markup supports all the standard DocBook frontmatter and
backmatter sections (dedication, preface, bibliography, glossary,
index, colophon) plus footnotes and index entries.

- This link:book.txt[AsciiDoc book] produced link:book.html[this HTML
  file] using the 'DocBook XSL Stylesheets'.
- The link:asciidoc.pdf[PDF formatted AsciiDoc User Guide] was
  generated from asciidoc(1) DocBook output.
- The link:asciidoc.epub[EPUB formatted AsciiDoc User Guide] was
  generated using link:a2x.1.html[a2x].
- This link:book.epub[EPUB formatted book skeleton] was generated
  using link:a2x.1.html[a2x].
- This link:book-multi.txt[multi-part AsciiDoc book] produced
  link:book-multi.html[this HTML file] using the 'DocBook XSL
  Stylesheets'.

Example UNIX Man Pages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
HTML formatted AsciiDoc man pages
link:asciidoc.1.css-embedded.html[with stylesheets] and
link:asciidoc.1.html[without stylesheets] were generated by AsciiDoc
from link:asciidoc.1.txt[this file].

This link:asciidoc.1[roff formatted  man page] was generated from
asciidoc(1) DocBook output using `xsltproc(1)` and DocBook XSL
Stylesheets.

Example Slideshows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The http://www.w3.org/Talks/Tools/Slidy2/[Slidy] backend generates
HTML slideshows that can be viewed in any web browser.  What's nice is
that you can create completely self contained slideshows including
embedded images.

- Here is the link:slidy.html[slidy backend documentation] slideshow
  and here is it's link:slidy.txt[AsciiDoc source].
- An link:slidy-example.html[example slidy slideshow] and the
  link:slidy-example.txt[AsciiDoc source].
